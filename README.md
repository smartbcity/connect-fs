# FS

---

# Description

FS (File System) is a micro-service for handling files. It serves both as an interface for S3 storage and SSM.

Each and every file uploaded to this service are saved within S3. Optionally, it is possible to hash and send some of those files into an SSM.

# Architecture

The communication with the S3 storage is done via a [MinIO](https://docs.min.io/docs/java-client-quickstart-guide.html) SDK, which can communicate with any S3-compatible API.

The communication with the SSM is done with an event-sourcing S2 automate and uses Redis as a cache.

    B --> D(SSM)
    B --> E(Redis)
```

# Getting Started

FS is designed to be deployed as a standalone micro-service.
A docker image can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/smartbcity/fs-gateway) and used in a docker-compose:

```yaml
version: "3.7"
services:
  fs-gateway:
    container_name: fs-gateway
    image: smartbcity/fs-gateway:${VERSION}
    environment:
      - fs_s3_internal-url=${INTERNAL_URL}
      - fs_s3_external-url=${EXTERNAL_URL}
      - fs_s3_bucket=${BUCKET}
      - fs_s3_password=${MINIO_PASS}
    ports:
      - 8090:8090
```

Once it is up and running, you can start making requests via HTTP.

⚠️ **To run FS, you need to have a reachable MinIO instance, and a Redis and a SSM if you want to use S2.**

If you are in a java environment, all the necessary models and commands can be found [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/city.smartb.fs/file-domain).
An SDK that sugarcoats the http requests is also available [here](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/city.smartb.fs/file-client).

```kotlin
implementation("city.smartb.fs:file-domain:${Versions.fs}")
implementation("city.smartb.fs:file-client:${Versions.fs}")
```

The client provided in the SDK uses Ktor under the hood and should be a singleton in your application in order to prevent any memory leak. Ex:

```kotlin
@Configuration
class FsConfig {

    @Value("\${platform.fs.url}")
    lateinit var fsUrl: String

    @Bean
    fun fsClient() = FileClient(
        url = fsUrl
    )
}
```
